In this project Angela Yu taught me how to include API's, and other Swift techniques to be able to create an app that can show the current exchange rate of BitCoin against several different International currencies.

This project taught me:
-	How to create a dark mode enabled app and use vector assets.
-	How to use the UITextField to get user input.
-	How about Swift Protocols and the Delegate Design Pattern.
-	How to work with APIs by making HTTP requests with URLSession.
-	How to Parse JSON with the native JSONDecoder.
-	How to use computes properties, closures, and extensions.
-	How to use Core Location to get the GPS data.

Definitely looking forward to incorporate API's into many app ideas I have that I will be creating once I finish this course with Angela Yu.
